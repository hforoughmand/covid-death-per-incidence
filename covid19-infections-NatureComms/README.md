# Substantial underestimation of COVID-19 infection in the United States due to incomplete testing and imperfect test accuracy

## Overview
To date, coronavirus testing in the US has been extremely limited. Confirmed COVID-19 case counts underestimate the total number of infections in the population. We estimated the total COVID-19 infections – both symptomatic and asymptomatic – in the US in March 2020. We used a semi-Bayesian approach to correct for bias due to incomplete testing and imperfect test performance.

**`0-config.R`** : configuration file that sets data directories, sources base functions, and loads required libraries

**`0-base-functions`** : folder containing scripts with functions used in the analysis
* `0-base-functions.R`: R script containing general functions used across the analysis
* `0-bias-corr-functions.R`: R script containing functions used in bias correction
* `0-bias-corr-functions-undertesting.R`: R script containing functions used in bias correction to estimate the percentage of underestimation due to incomplete testing vs. imperfect test accuracy
* `0-prior-functions.R`: R script containing functions to generate priors
